# selenium_project_1
A very basic webscraper using selenium and BeautifulSoup

The scraper did not require an agent to bypass basic security which is generally the case for common websites such as Amazon
One of the key python functions required was a try loop which was used to find the description of a shoe which wasn't always present on the webpages of the trainers.
